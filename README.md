# Medical Image Classification

This project was a part of a Machine Learning course. The goal is to classify medical images into categories, using neural networks.

This archive contains the following files:

## download_octmnist.py
- allows you to download the OCTMNIST dataset to a compressed .npz file, which hw1-q2.py and hw1-q3.py can load.

## hw1-q1.py
- contains code for Question 1, which covers classification with the perception, logistic regression, and the multi-layer perceptron, with implementation in numpy.

## hw1-q2.py
- contains code for Question 2, which covers classification with logistic regression and the multi-layer perceptron, with implementation in torch.
